            <h3>About Grenada</h3>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Long before the 1800s saw shiploads of cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg leaving our shores, Grenada's encounter with zest had already unfolded.</p>
            <p>African and Amerindian stories, told in English and Creole dialects, began blending with rhythmic beats of drum and dance to form a cultural melting pot. Today, it offers a glimpse into a centuries-old history through the warm lens of our people.</p>
